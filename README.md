# Finding Markets to Advertise a Product

Tools used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn). 

Suppose our company offered an E-Learning subscription based product that taught users to code. Which markets do we advertise in to maximize outreach and growth? In this project, I decided to analyze how a product offering coding courses can target markets based on data from a survey. I cleaned the data, visualized, corrected for outliers, analyzed and then concluded with the 2 best markets to advertise in.
